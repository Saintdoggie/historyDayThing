        <p class="paragraph">
            Computing before Operating Systems was very basic. 
            Computers were only owned by big companies, or big schools, and they only ran one program at a time, 
            using magnetic tape, or punch cards, and had to manually insert new programs.  
            People eventually started using Compilers for development instead of punchcards. 
            And the system libraries that ran below programs, began getting more complex, adding features like logging, and automatic program execution.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Eventually you could call these background programs Operating Systems because they had support for features like filesystems, and users.
