        <p class="paragraph">
            Computing before modern operating systems was very basic. 
            Computers were only owned by big companies, or big schools, and they only ran one program at a time, 
            using magnetic tape, or punch cards, and people had to manually insert new programs.  
            Soon the early operating systems that ran below programs, began getting more complex, adding features like logging, and automatic program execution.

        <p class="paragraph">
            Eventually early Operating Systems started getting more advanced.
            Then came Multics, which had a number of cool features like multiple language support and virtual memory.
            Multi Lanaguage support means that people can use different programming languages to program.
            Virtual Memory is additional computer memory, that allows a computer to have more memory without installing more, like making part of a disk memory, slow, but can help with low memory. 
            But Multics was very bloated and slow, it had many features but had issues with performance.
            So some of the people who were working on it decided to make Unix.
            Unix was designed to be much simpler, which is where the Unix philosophy came from.
            While Multics never really blew up, Unix did. Which is what the next section is about.
