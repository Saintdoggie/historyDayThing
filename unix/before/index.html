            Computing before any form of operating system(OS) was very basic, Computers ran only one program at a time, <br>
            using magnetic tape, or punch cards, and people had to manually insert new programs. <br>
            Soon Computers had become more powerful, and the computer was sitting idle in between tasks. <br>
