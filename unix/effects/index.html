    <p class="paragraph">
        The effects of Unix are all over the place, the internet, integrated devices, and many other places.
        Unix ideas are still being in use since the seventies.
        Unix will continue to live on in Linux and every other Unix like system.

    <p class="subtitle">Linux</p>

    <p class="paragraph">
        Linux is kind of the successor to Unix, it uses much of the same philosiphy.
        Linux uses the philosiphy that everything is a file.
        Linux also very modular, everything program can be substituted.
        Linux is arguably the most popular Operating System.
        Linux is used in many servers and mobile devices.  
        In the server realm it is often used because it is easy to run and is much less money to run(like windows server).
        In the mobile realm it runs android, which is about 70 percent of mobile market share.
        A linux system runs with the linux kernel and gnu coreutils at minimum.
        Linux is a kernel, and needs the gnu coreutils to operate as a OS.
