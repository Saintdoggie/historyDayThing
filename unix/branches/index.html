        <p class="title">The Branches of Unix</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            There are many branches of Unix, so this will be about some of the big ones.
            In the beginning there was the original Unix, created by Thompson, Ritchie, McLlroy, and Ossanna.
            Unix Version 1 - 4 was written in assembly, 5-6 was written in mostly C.
            After Version four Unix was rewritten in C.
            After a while there were two major versions, System V(System five) and BSD(Berkeley Software Distribution).
        </p>
        
        <p class="subtitle">BSD</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            BSD was a kind of rival to System V, and was developed by the Computer Systems Research Group.
            BSD had a few differences to System V, like using a tty instead of a termio.
            BSD has a few current Operating Systems still being developed, the most popular ones are called FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.

        <p class="subtitle">System V</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            System V was the successor of System III(System Three), and was Developed by AT&T.
            System V was commercial Unix Version, which means that people generally had to pay to use it. 
            System V had different versions, System V version 1 is called SVR1.
            SVR1 had a few new features like the vi editor and curses.
            Vi was a console file editor that is generally used by System Admins, though has mostly been succeded by Vim.
            Curses is a terminal library for text user interfaces, and was originally from 4.1 BSD.
            SVR2 added a bunch of useful backend features.
            SVR3 added remote file sharing and the virtual file system.
            Remote file sharing is a way to share files in a network with Unix devices.
            A virtual file system is file system that is not on a physical device.
            SVR4 add many different features from many other Unix Versions.
            From BSD it got TCP sockets and the C shell.
            From SunOS it got a new virtual memory system.
            From Xenix it got x86 device drivers and compatibilty with Xenix.
            In SVR5 got some improvements for servers, and was acquired by the SCO.
            SVR6 was canceled but was sopposed to have support for 64 bit systems.
            SVR5 was the last version of System V to get released.
