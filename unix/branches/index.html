        <p class="title">The Branches of Unix</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            There are many branches of Unix, so this will be about some of the big ones.
            In the beginning there was the original Unix, created by Thompson, Ritchie, McLlroy, and Ossanna.
            Unix Version 1 - 4 was written in assembly, 5-6 was written in mostly C.
            After Version four Unix was rewritten in C.
            After a while there were two major versions, System V(System five) and BSD(Berkeley Software Distribution).
            System V was the successor of System III(System Three) and had a few differences to BSD, like using streams instead of sockets like BSD does.
            
            It is found on the widest variety of computers an operating system could claim. 
            The Unix operating system plays a big role in the current market landscape and is an enabler of technologies such as cloud computing, security, virtualization, mobility etc.
