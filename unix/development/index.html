        <p class="title">Developing Unix</p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Unix was written two different programming languages.
            C and Assembly, assembly is used for booting because it is very low level and programmers can control everything better.
            Unix is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell, and the userspace programs.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The kernel is the core of the operating system.
            It handles everything that is low level; memory management, task scheduling, and more.
            Task scheduling involves handling which programs get access cpu resources, and minimizing system resource waste.
            Memory management is similar to task scheduling except it handles memory.
            Device management though, is handled by drivers, which is software that interacts with a device, most hardware that unix(or any related operating system's) is handled by drivers.

        <p class="paragraph">
            The shell allows the user to manipulate the system through text based prompt.
            All programs are launched from the shell.
            In order to launch a program, you have type a program name, then the shell looks in your PATH, then either finds the program, if it finds it, it is launched, if not, a error message is displayed.
            There are many shells including the Bourne Again Shell(bash) and the C shell(csh). 
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The userspace programs, are the part that people interact with.
            They have many different forms, and can be compiled or interpreted.
            Compiled means that the program is not in a plain text format and is not readable by a Human.
            Interpreted means that it is readable in plain text, but is usually slower than Compiling, an advantage thought is that you can modify or view the program before running it.
