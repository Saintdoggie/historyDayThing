            In the beginning of computers(add date), you had to write machine code on magnetic or paper tape<br>
            But the problem with this was that demand for using computers began to go by a lot, and people could be really inefficient in using the computer<br>
            And so the company's that ran the computers had to start adding features that would handle things such as cpu scheduling<br>
