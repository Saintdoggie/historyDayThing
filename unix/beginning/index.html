                In the beginning of computers, you had to write machine code on magnetic or paper tap.<br>

                But the problem with this was that demand for using computers began to go by a lot, and people could be really inefficient in using the computer.<br>

                And so the company's that ran the computers had to start adding features that would handle things such as cpu scheduling.<br>

                And so slowly computers were getting more and more sophisticated programs that handled running other programs.<br>
