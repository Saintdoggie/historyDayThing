            The Process of Our Project
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The reason we chose our topic is because we both have interests in the computer field. We also coded some
            some separate projects before, and our friends really liked them. When we found out about History Day
            and that they allowed websites, the first thing we did was ask to be partners, because we both knew that we could make something cool together.
            We decided our topic to be something related to computers since we're working with a computer. We then thought of Unix, the first
            multi-tasking operating system.

            We first had to build the structure of the website first. It took a lot of work to think of a web design
            that we could actually make. We decided to go with the simple look since Unix was supposed to be simple.
            Our first source was from paper essays that we made seperately. We used the sources from the paper and 
            later on used sources from informative websites.

            The History of Unix fits the theme of "Frontiers in History" because without it we probably wouldn't have had fast computers we have today.
            Before Unix, computers were very slow since they only had single tasking systems. Since Multics became too complex to work on, people abandoned it. Then came the spark
            that lit the new generation of operating systems(aka Unix). Some time after Unix became popular, new computers coming with Unix were fast computer for the time.
            Unix influenced all the operating systems today
