            The reason we chose our topic is because we both have interests in the computer field. We also coded some
            some separate projects before, and our friends really liked them. When we found out about History Day
            and that they allowed websites, the first thing we did was ask to be partners, because we both knew that we could make something cool together.
            We decided our topic to be something related to computers since we're working with a computer. We then thought of Unix, the first
            multi-tasking operating system.
